        <h2> Pat's Salmon Cookies was started when Pat got snowed in the mountains of Montana in the Winter of 2000. Supplies were limited and the only food available were cans of pureed Salmon, flour and sugar. Pat liked to be creative and so Salmon Cookies
            were created. When all the people back home heard the story they were all begging to try out this new delicacy. Pat has Salmon Cookie stores all over the world now and more are coming soon!
